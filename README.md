# vent-thermostat-controller
This project solves the issue of a single, over cooled room by attaching a servo to the vent controlled by a Arduino thermostat. The thermostat allows the user to adjust and set the room temperature to the most comfortable level. This is a great solution to anybody who constanly adjusts the vent because the room is too warm or too cold. The arduino thermostat has an lcd display that automaticly shuts off when not in use to save power. It also fetures AI to track your body heat input with a thermal camera...... JUST KIDDING, no cammeras at all, I'll leave those weird shonanogans to google ;)
